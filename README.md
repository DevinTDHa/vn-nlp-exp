# Vietnamese Natural Language Processing Experiments

This repo contains all the scripts that I wrote for various NLP experiments. They are
explained in more detail on my [blog](https://devintdha.github.io/projects/).

Currently it contains the following experiments:

1. Some dirty and unordered Jupyter notebooks to process the Open Subtitles Actually
   Open Edition and other nonsense in the [notebooks[(/notebooks) folder
2. Word Segmentation using VnCoreNLP on multiple cores the [word_segmentation](/word_segmentation)
   folder

The results are published as [releases](/releases) section and are tagged like the
folder names.
