# Scripts to use and process VnCoreNLP results

This folder contains scripts to use and process VnCoreNLP results.
They are separated into the languages of the scripts and also contain README files for
further details about usage and purpose of scripts.

If a script is not documented, then you can assume it's not really needed and considered
deprecated.
